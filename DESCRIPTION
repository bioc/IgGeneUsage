Description: Decoding the properties of immune repertoires is key in 
    understanding the response of adaptive immunity to challenges such as 
    viral infection. One important task in immune repertoire profiling is 
    the detection of biases in Ig gene usage between biological conditions. 
    IgGeneUsage is a computational tool for the analysis of differential gene 
    usage in immune repertoires. It employs Bayesian hierarchical models to 
    fit complex gene usage data from immune repertoire sequencing experiments 
    and quantifies Ig gene usage biases as probabilities.
